## Find Finn The Dog

***About:*** My deranged dog, Finn, went missing for two weeks early - mid August 2022. I threw this repo together in about 3-4 hours one night so that there could be a central source of information for people who wanted to help spread the word about finding him. The idea was that if people spotted him in the area, they could sign in with Google on this website and post their sighting for others to see. Ultimately, Finn was found two weeks later exactly where he was lost – safe and unharmed, but he lost around 10% of his body mass. We're incredibly fortunate to have gotten him back, and this project was a good test of my skills to build a website with NextJS and Firebase in a couple of hours.

## Technologies Used:

### Frontend

- Website built with NextJS, deployed on Vercel
- CSS done with TailwindCSS

### Backend
- Firebase (for user login and ability to add Finn sightings. I'd never used Firebase before this, so I had to learn on the spot)
